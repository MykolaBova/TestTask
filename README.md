# Test task

A repository that contains a test task.

# Task 1. Anagrams.
Checking the two words is whether they are anagrams.
The basic idea is to divide the two String into two arrays, then sort them and compare them.

Java.util library is used for sorting.

To find the unique letters in the first word was used HashSet and removeAll method.
This approach will ensure performance.

# Task 2. Pretty Printer.
### Task 2 Version 1.
Allows operation with the report which was in the task. When reading a CSV file, an entity is created with the possibility of further work with it.
In this approach, all fields are read correctly (Double -> Double, Long -> Long)

### Task 2 Version 2.
This approach prints a table dynamically from any CSV file.
It does not matter how many columns or rows there.

This approach is suitable for printing, since all data that is read is of String type.
